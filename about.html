      <h1>About us</h1>
      <h3>What is VOYU?</h3>
        <p>VOYU (Varangian Orthodox Christian Youth Union) is a pan-orthodox group aimed at university students. 
Our goal is to create a group for interaction with other Australian Orthodox Christians and those interested in Orthodox Christianity. 
VOYU is based on the idea of a bringing together of Orthodox cultures (reflecting the makeup of the Byzantine emperor's Varangian guard and the usage of the Varangians by the Byzantines). 
Our goal is to create Orthodox outreach to other university students as well as to provide activities, talks and social interactions between Orthodox university students. 
While our focus as a group is being unifying, we also wish to create a focus on English language mission and spiritual culture for specifically Australia. 
We also believe in the idea of masculinity in a proper Orthodox context as exemplified again by the Varangian theme.</p>

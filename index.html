			<h4 class='intro'>Who Are We?</h4>
				<p>VOYU (Varangian Orthodox Christian Youth Union) is a pan-orthodox group aimed at university students. Our goal is to create a group for interaction with other Australian Orthodox Christians and those interested in Orthodox Christianity. VOYU is based on the idea of a bringing together of Orthodox cultures (reflecting the makeup of the Byzantine emperor's Varangian guard and the usage of the Varangians by the Byzantines).</p>
    			<h1 class='title'>Our Goal</h1>
				<p>We want to create an Orthodox outreach to other university students as well as to provide activities, talks and social interactions between Orthodox university students. While our focus as a group is being unifying, we also wish to create a focus on English language mission and spiritual culture for specifically Australia. We also believe in the idea of masculinity in a proper Orthodox context as exemplified again by the Varangian theme.</p>
